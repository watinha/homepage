However <a href=\"http://pyccuracy.org\">pyccuracy</a> still have not implemented actions that can be classified as accessible for disabled users like \"tabbing navigation\", focus possibility for interactive elements, landmarks and header navigation, among other actions. The goal of implementing accessibility actions for pyccuracy is to be able to execute acceptance tests of web applications functionality, considering disabled users task completion with assistive technologies. These users do no rely on the same visual and interactive mechanisms such as mouse and link colors, for example. So pyccuracy actions must consider these characteristics to guarantee that the functionality of the web application is available for all users. From the development perspective, accessibility actions drive automatic accessibility evaluation tools into a Continuous Integration environment. Making it possible to include accessibility non-functional requirements into the development life-cycle of projects and assisting developers while coding solutions for them." },
